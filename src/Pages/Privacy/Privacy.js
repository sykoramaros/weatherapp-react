        <h3 class="mt-4">1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          WeatherApp does not collect personally identifiable information unless
          explicitly provided by you.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Location data (only when you provide location input for weather
            services).
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage data, such as app performance, pages visited, and interaction
            behavior.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Information</h3>
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide accurate weather data based on your location.</li>

        <p>
          We may use third-party services like weather APIs (e.g.,
          OpenWeatherMap) to deliver accurate data. These services may have
          their own privacy policies.
